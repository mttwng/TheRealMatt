              <p id = "p1">I started this venture when my friend saw that I was getting a lot of interviews and asked me to look over his resume. 
              After I worked with him, he immediately got several interviews, one of which led to his first internship.<br /><br /></p>
              <p id = "p2">Since then, I have expanded my business through friend referrals and Facebook posts to try and help as many people as I can. 
              I found that though the majors and schools may differ, the underlying problems amongst my clients' resumes were strikingly similar. 
              After getting numerous positive responses and establishing myself, I made the switch over to a paid service. <br /><br /></p>
              <p id = "p3">My goal is to help people get as many interviews as possible to better leverage their skills in today's job market. 
              If you like what you see, I encourage you to sign up and send over your resume. 
              You'll be wondering why you didn't work with me earlier.<br /><br /></p>
