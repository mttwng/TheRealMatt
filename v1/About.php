      <h3>School</h3>
      <br />
      <p>

      <h3>Summer</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        This summer I managed to learn some web development and design. I picked up CSS, HTML, jQuery UI &amp; PHP. I worked as Web Developer at <a href="http://vytalla.com/" target="_blank"  class="direct">Vytal LA</a> where I was contracted to build complete web solutions. I developed websites using tools such as <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" class="direct">Wordpress</a> and even hard coded a few. For my own website, I first wrote it in hard code, and then upgraded to write it on top of <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/index.html" target="_blank" class="direct">Bootstrap</a> to learn more about responsive design.

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I explore. I love to learn new things and venture to new places. Exploring different cultures has taught me so much about the different intricacies of the world. While traveling, one thing I love to do is go scuba-diving. I am a licensed diver, and have dived in beautiful places all over the world; hoping to head to the legendary Maldives one day.

      <h3>Future</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The future holds a lot for me. I want to travel, learn and code. After I graduate I hope to work as a Product Manager, utilizing my programming and leadership skills. My bucket list includes wanting to build an Android App, work internationally and to become an Advanced Open Water Scuba Diver. Life is amazing, and I can only hope to accomplish as much as I possibly can.
